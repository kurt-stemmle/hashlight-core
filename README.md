# hashlight-core

We build solidity contracts to define how we will interact with the ethereum network. Here can be found how the hashlight organization interacts with the ethereum network. We have several different contracts but the most important contract from an outside observer would be the code found inside the HashCanvasUserFactory and the HashCanvasUser. When an individual comes to the hashlight website and creates a new nft they are given full ownership of the solidity contract that just so happens to implement the ERC721 interface making it a mintable NFT that can be sold at NFT auction.
